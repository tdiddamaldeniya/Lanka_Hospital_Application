Introduction- Lanka Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System was created expressly to address the requirements of Lanka Hospital. According to their request, all major modules and functionalities that are required have been created. Hospital management systems are necessary for all healthcare facilities, including Patient management, and room management and diseases management. Computerizing all patientâ€™s data and hospital data is the main goal on this project. Every healthcare facility wants to give patients the finest care possible, and installing this software makes administrative work easier.

Project Objective

Hospitals are an essential component of our lives because they provide the best medical care to those who are ill with a wide range of diseases that may be triggered by a change in the weather or an increase in work demands. To make sure that everything operates smoothly and correctly, the daily activities and records of the hospital's patients, doctors, nurses, care boys, and other staff members must be monitored.

Health care organizations may collect, store, manage, analyze, and optimize patient treatment histories and other important data with the use of a health information system. These platforms also make it simple for healthcare professionals to learn about larger settings, such as changes in community health.

A well-designed hospital information system makes patient data easily accessible to healthcare professionals. All the necessary information on a patient from multiple hospital departments can be accessed on the screen with just a few clicks.


 



Functional Requirements

Function	Description
System Administrator Login	The System Admin logs in to the system using this function. I have already created 2 System Admin accounts.  After registering, System Admin can log into the system using his email and password. 

Additionally- Username and password will be given after user registration has been confirmed. When entering the password, it should be encrypted and hidden.


Manage Patient 	After successfully logging to system. System admin can access manage patient model. In this model admin can register patient to hospital system, update/delete patient from whole system.
System admin can get patients full information from this model.
Manage Room	After successfully logging to system. System admin can access manage Room model. In this model admin can add rooms to hospital management system, update/delete rooms from whole system. 
System admin can assign rooms to patient from this model.
Manage Disease 	After successfully logging to system. System admin can access manage disease model. In this model admin can add disease to hospital management system, update/delete disease from whole system. 
System admin can assign disease to patient from this model.











Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Function	Description 
Maintainability	The system must fulfil the requirements of its administrators and developers in terms of maintenance. This system is equipped with functions like error handlers to boost the productivity of resolving mistakes, flaws, and general
Security	In order to ensure the protection of the data and information held inside the system, it is necessary for the system to be secured and protected.
Performance	It is necessary for the system to be safe and protected in order to verify that the data and information contained there are protected. The system must respond to user demands in a far shorter length of time than is now the case. The newest front-end and back-end technologies are used in the development of this system to maximize their seamless interoperability and boost system performance.
Usability	The system must satisfy the needs of its users by being simple to use and comprehend. This system was created with the idea that it might be utilized by people of all backgrounds.




DevOps 

The collection of automated procedures and instruments known as a DevOps pipeline is used by the development and operations teams to compile, assemble, test, and deploy software code more quickly and easily. The word "pipeline" doesn't quite match because it's more like an assembly line. An automobile, for instance, goes through continuous assembly on the factory assembly line. The chassis is first constructed, then the engine, doors, tires, seats, and instrument panel are added, and finally, the exterior paint is applied.

To enhance the efficiency and integrity of software deployment, a DevOps team consists of developers and IT operations personnel that collaborate throughout the product lifecycle. Teams and the organizations they work for will be significantly impacted by this new method of working, or cultural shift.
Development and operations teams are no longer "siloed" under a DevOps approach. These two teams can occasionally combine to form a single team of engineers who work across the whole application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment and operations, and who possess a variety of multidisciplinary abilities.

 





System Planning and Design

UML Diagrams 

In order to better understand, update, maintain, or document information about the system, a UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) that aims to visually describe a system together with its primary players, roles, actions, artifacts, or classes.
Data flow diagram

A data flow diagram shows how information moves through any system or process. It displays the system and how it interacts with outside elements. We can observe how the pharmacists and the system's process flow interact in this instance.
 


Class diagram 

The class diagram shows the information or data handling structures for the hospital administration system. Classes will be utilized to represent these informational facts or components. According to the methods the hospital management system will use, each class will have its own characteristics.
